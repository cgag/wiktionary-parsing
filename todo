The current idea:
  Given "para": we want to show osmething like
  para, parar: <count>

  Given "fue", we want "ser, ir: <count>"

  Basically, only show the conjugated form if it also happens to be another part of speech,
  never show it for verbs.

  Later: try to actually identify parts of speech.

Implement basic web interface for getting and displaying all the information about a word.  Use this to figure out how close we are to having everything working. 
Implement basics of doing frequency counting.
Actually store the entries in a db.  Datomic?

para #{parir, parar}
fue  #{ser, ir}
fui  #{ser, ir}
es   #{ser}

ser, ir: 2
para, parir, para: 1
